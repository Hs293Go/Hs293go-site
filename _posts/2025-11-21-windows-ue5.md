## Generating Visual Studio Project Files

Most tutorials advise us to generate Visual Studio `.sln` project files by right-clicking on the `.uproject` file and selecting the "Generate Visual Studio Project Files" option.

However, I'm convinced this approach is inherently flawed. 
Initiating project file generation this way makes the process almost opaque --- a window with a progress bar and a *show logs* button appears very briefly and vanishes afterwards.

Inability to see logs becomes **fatal** when you know that the project generator continues even if it encounters errors, producing a `.sln` file that is **wrong** and could cause Visual Studio to hang when trying to open the project, leading to the dreaded unending _Preparing solution_ screen.

On the other hand, the "Generate ..." button may vanish into thin air.
This is because the mere existence of the button depends on the registration of Unreal Engine installations and file associations, which have a track record of spontaneously becoming invalid on my machine.
Reddit threads and forum answers variously suggest running `UnrealVersionSelector.exe /register` and `UnrealVersionSelector.exe -fileassociations` to reestablish these registrations, in various orders, with various combinations of flags, and from various working directories.

Cue the CLI version of generating Visual Studio project files (**All credits go to https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/generate-vs-project-files-by-command-line/277707**):

``` powershell
& "C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.5\Engine\Binaries\DotNET\UnrealBuildTool\UnrealBuildTool.exe" -projectfiles -project="$PWD\HelloUnreal.uproject" -game -rocket -progress
```

> Cargo cultists beware: Replace the path to `UnrealBuildTool.exe` and the path to the `.uproject` to match your environment
